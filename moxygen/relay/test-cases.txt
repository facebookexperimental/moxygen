x fetch with complete cache miss [no track]
x fetch with a complete cache miss [track has cached data but disjoint range]

x subscribe + writeback populates cache

x fetch + writeback
x fetch populates OBJECT_NOT_EXIST, GROUP_NOT_EXIST

x non-live track, fetch completely satisifed by cache
partial fetch hits:
  1. x Missing beginning -> wait for missing beginning before fetchimpl
     x needs fetch OK
     doen't need fetchOK
  2. x Missing middle, multiple misses
  3. x Missing end
  4. x Ask for complete group but not known end-of-group

fetch on a live track
1. x No objects - forward upstream
2. x End > latest - fetch ok has latest, no upstream

x fetch end beyond end of track
fetch waits for a fetch in progress
1. x Success
2. x fetch in progress errors

x upstream fetch error
upstream fetch error tail
upstream fetch tail needs fetch ok

x upstream reset the stream

consumer->object BLOCKED
1. x await succeeds
2. x await fails

x consumer->object fails for another reason (cancel?)

Fetching an object that is not complete

Malformed track (duplicate end_of_track)
